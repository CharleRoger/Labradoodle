# Labradoodle
A simple mod which splits the two model options of the Poodle engine into separate parts.
- The RE-L10 "Poodle" retains its original stats, but only has the single-nozzle variant
- The multi-nozzle variant becomes a new part, the RE-L20 "Labrador", with stats somewhere between the Poodle and the Skipper.

Compatible with Restock and in theory anything else which patches the Poodle, e.g. for Waterfall effects.
